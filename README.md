# ðŸ¤ž Build my own X
This repository will contain my codes as I try to create at least a few things from the great list at [https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x).

## X is one among following:
- [CLI Tool](./cli-tool/): Gitty, a CLI tool to let user view their Git contributions for Git repositories on their system.
- [Git App](./git-app): Giffy, the Git Bot, comments back with a Gif whenever invoked.
