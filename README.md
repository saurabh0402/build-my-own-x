# ðŸ¤ž Build my own X
This repository will contain my codes as I try to create at least a few things from the great list at [https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x).

## X is one among following:
- [Git App](./git-app): Giffy, the Git Bot, comments back with a Gif whenever invoked. ðŸ§™
- [Module Bundler](./module-bundler): Bundly, a simple, tiny JavaScript Module Bundler. ðŸ“¦
- [React](./react): Reflex, a simple react clone. ðŸ’ƒ
