# Gitty 🐱
## What is Gitty? 🤔
Continuing with the trend of having un-inspirational names, here's **Gitty**, a command-line tool, written in Golang, that allows you to visualize you Git contributions for repositories you have on your system.

## Ideas 💡
I will be following the tutorial first and get a simple version of the tool ready. After that there are a few ideas that I would like to visit:
- **Namespaces** : Ability to create a new namespace and then add folders to that namespace and thus get stats for that namespace only so that one could check how much has one contributed to side projects, job, etc.
- **.giffyignore** : Rather than hardcoding folders that are to be skipped like - node_modules, .git, etc this will allow user to add more folders to this list if one wants to.
