# Bundly 📦
Bundly ( another uninspirational name, I know 🙈 ) is a simple JavaScript module bundler. The main aim here is to 
get a better understanding on how bundlers work and in the way get myself a tiny bundler (that atleast does some bundling) ready.

## What are Module Bundlers? 🤔
The very first question that needs to be answered here is what module bundlers are. So, Module Bundlers are tools that package all of our required modules into a single file. This way we only need to add a single file as a dependency into our HTML file 🎉. Most famous one is - Webpack.
